Installation instructions for Gongo (assuming you are using my (traveller42) fork):

1) Install the "go" command. 

Instructions: http://golang.org/doc/install.html

2) Make sure that $GOPATH is set somewhere reasonable.

mkdir go
cd go
export GOPATH=`pwd`

3) Create the necessary directories

mkdir -p src/github.com/skybrian

4) Clone the repository

cd src/github.com/skybrian/
git clone https://github.com/traveller42/Gongo.git

4) Run tests

cd Gongo
go test

5) Install binaries

go install ./gongo ./gongo-benchmark

6) Try out the benchmark

$GOPATH/bin/gongo-benchmark

The "gongo-benchmark" program plays games against itself out to a given
number of moves. It's useful mostly for performance testing.

7) Install GoGui

http://gogui.sourceforge.net/

The "gongo" program is a Go player that speaks the GTP protocol. It's
possible to run it directly, but better to use a user interface such as
GoGui.

8) Configure GoGui to use Gongo

In GoGui, attach the Gongo program. Select:

   Program -> New Program... 

Then enter the full path to the "gongo" executable and the number of playouts
wanted. For example, here's how I run it (you may have to replace $GOPATH with
the literal value, i.e. /home/user/go):

  $GOPATH/bin/gongo 10000

9) Play some games

You can play games against Gongo or have it play itself. To have Gongo play
itself on a 9x9 board:

Game -> New Game
Game -> Board Size -> 9
Game -> Computer Color -> Both
