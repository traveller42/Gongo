This is my (Clark Wierda) fork of Brian's code by way of smallsweet's fork.
I'm primarily using this program to test Go Text Protocol engine testing
harnesses (and learn more about the Go language).

From the original repository:

Gongo - a Go player written in Go
Author: Brian Slesinsky
Last update: December 6, 2009

This is a simple computer program that plays Go, but not very well. I
wrote it while learning the Go programming language. It's mostly of interest
as a starting point for people who might want to write Go robots in Go,
and as a example of a reasonably well-commented program written in the
Go language.

The algorithm is based on the Java reference bot by Don Dailey, with some
performance improvements. The Java refbot is described here:
